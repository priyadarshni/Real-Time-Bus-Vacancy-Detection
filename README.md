# Real-Time-Bus-Vacancy-Detection
The purpose of the project is to understand the feasibility of implementing Internet of Things in bus transportation system in Pune. The system proposes a Real Time bus vacancy detection using IoT to reduce the long waiting period by providing bus location and seat occupancy to the passengers on their smart phones. The features like bus location and seat occupancy can be provided so that the passenger wonâ€™t waste time waiting at the bus stop for a crowded bus. The use of weight sensors (load cell) ensures accuracy and Raspberry Pi provides real time information processing. Each weight sensor will give the load of an area of the bus and accordingly the vacancy will be determined. This system would ensure optimal use of public transportation prevents congestion at bus platform, keeps passengers informed in a flexible manner and provides convenience.
